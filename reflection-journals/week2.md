## Peer assessment

Ngoc (5) — Scrum Master: Ngoc proactively manages the schedule, breaks down and assigns tasks, and ensures everyone stays on track. She also helps teammates keep up with theory lessons and explains activities when anything is unclear.

Thanh (5) — Full-stack Developer: Thanh reliably delivers her tasks. She studies Figma to ensure the front end matches our design expectations and contributes many ideas to make the website more user-friendly.

Hoang (5) — Full-stack Developer: Hoang works hard to keep up with classes. He completes assigned tasks and spends significant time studying. We pair-program nearly every day to resolve issues from activities. He is highly motivated and committed to learning.

## Reflection


### Challenges Faced:

Learning a new programming language is challenging at first. This course requires absorbing many concepts quickly, which means frequent review and correction of mistakes. Balancing full-time work with coursework demands careful time management to stay on track. I find coding manageable when I follow the course materials and persist in solving problems independently. The project progressed smoothly because our team agreed on a shared vision early and began implementation immediately.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

This week’s activities helped me absorb the theory much better. After group work and pair programming, the concepts became clearer. I learned that steady effort and focused time can reduce the initial anxiety that comes with new information and skills.

- Key Learning:

Prepare before theory sessions (skim materials, note questions).

Code it yourself first, then compare with examples/solutions.

Pair programming and helping others accelerate learning and reveal blind spots.

Regularly revise what was taught, otherwise it fades quickly.

- Online Resources:


I looked up the same theory in my own language so I can get it more clear like videos from youtube , articles .

### Coping Strategies:


- Academic Progress:

I learned more about Git and GitHub and how they work. I also learned how the front end and back end work together. I learned how to build commands and how to test them. I learned how the front end works by combining components.

- Soft Skills Development:

I discussed with many classmates and felt free to express myself while listening to their experiences. I developed my group communication skills due to daily Scrum meetings.

### Project Management:

Sprint 1 is our focus. We have decided what to do for the project. We divided the work into: Figma, user stories, product backlog, and using Trello to keep the schedule. Everybody has to study on their own and check each other’s work to make sure things are good and under control. We know what functions our website should have and how it is going to be designed based on that. We are also preparing for the Sprint 1 presentation.

### Final Thoughts:

I see that me and our group is doing well even though there are alot of things to do. We will keep in track I think. I hope I will control about studying and personal life at least in two months.

### Next Steps:

Focusing on theory lessons and coding . Continue working on our project.
